#### API to interact with your pet's life

This is a personal project made with Python/Flask with some html test pages, that is intended to be consumed by a frontend framework.

### The goal

The objective in a mid-term is to create a mobile app that works for pets owners  to make peluditos life better and to make the owner's job easier with functions of tracking and social network. The idea came from the need to make life of our pets greater than now.
